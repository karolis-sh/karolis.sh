When using a single machine with multiple git accounts, you might encounter some obstacles with SSH setup. The easiest way to achieve a multi-user setup is to structure git repositories by respective directories, e.g.:

```
projects
â”œâ”€â”€ work
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ enterprise-fiz-buz
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ personal
    â”œâ”€â”€ karolis.sh
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

This short tutorial will help you set up SHH for such workflow.

## Generating a new SSH key

To generate a new SSH key, use the provided template script (or check the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)):

```shell
export EMAIL=karolis.sarapnickis@work.com
export SSH_FILE=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_work
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C $EMAIL -f $SSH_FILE
ssh-add -K $SSH_FILE
echo "ðŸ”½ PUBLIC KEY BELOW ðŸ”½" && cat $SSH_FILE.pub
pbcopy < $SSH_FILE.pub
```

What's left is to add the SSH key to your [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys)/[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys)/etc. account.

## Multi-user Git SSH setup

The general idea is that you use specific [ssh command](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config.html#Documentation/git-config.txt-coresshCommand) based on your working directory with the help of [git includes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config.html#_includes).

Update the `~/.gitconfig` file:

```yaml
[user]
  name = Karolis Å arapnickis
  email = hi@karolis.sh
[core]
  sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[push]
  default = current
[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/work/"]
  path = ~/.gitconfig.work
```

And the `~/.gitconfig.work` file:

```yaml
[user]
  email = karolis.sarapnickis@work.com
[core]
  sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

And that's it! Appropriate SSH setup will be used based on directory location, no extra actions are needed.
