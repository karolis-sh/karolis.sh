## The Core Feeling

The sublime — vastness, quiet immensity. The site should feel like standing at the edge of something larger than yourself. Not ominous, just immense.

## Visual Principles

### Color

- Background: deep blue-black, not pure black
- Palette: muted, monochrome
- Accents: dim, like distant light — never bright or saturated

### Space

- Generous negative space
- Content floats in emptiness

### Texture

- Subtle grain/noise for depth
- Atmosphere, not flatness

### Particles

- Sparse, slow drift
- Distant points of light, not dust
- Ambient life, not decoration
- Simplified on mobile

### Typography

- Clean sans-serif
- Large, confident, generous spacing
- Readable but not harsh

---

## Layout

- Minimal scrolling
- No section headers or card layouts
- Flow over structure

---

## What to Avoid

- Bright colors, saturated accents
- Playful/bouncy animations
- Landing page aesthetics (sections, cards, CTAs)
- Template look (generic Tailwind/shadcn)
- Literal space imagery

---

## Tech
